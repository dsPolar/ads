I've intended, at least at the beginning, that this repo doesn't have the actual dataset on it just as a potential privacy thingymajig.
Instead add code that generates your new dataset from the original. My code assumes that the original csv sits in /screenTime/ but just make it clear in the code
what it expects and it should be fine.

I've been mainly porting to and writing new code on colaboratory but we can see how this whole thing goes.
Oh yeah here's the colab link for ease of use if people want to jump around.
