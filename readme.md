I've intended, at least at the beginning, that this repo doesn't have the actual dataset on it just as a potential privacy thingymajig.
Instead add code that generates the data set. My code assumes that the original csv sits in /screenTime/ but just make it clear in the code
what it expects and it should be fine.

I've been mainly porting to and writing new code on colaboratory but we can see how this whole thing goes.
